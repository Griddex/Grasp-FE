Logging: every action goes through this middleware, so we can log its type and payload for debugging or tracking purposes.

Error tracking: if any asynchronous action returned an error, this middleware can display a notification.

Caching: Only call your API for the same action once, and cache the result for future calls.

Auth requests: For API calls, apply an authentication token before sending out the request.
